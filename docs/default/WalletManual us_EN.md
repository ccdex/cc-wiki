Cross-Chain assets deposit/withdraw
-----------------------------------

Deposit of cross-chain asset refers to the operation of mapping assets
from other block chains to CCDEX through DCCP cross-chain protocol, and
then can trade and transfer with other kinds of assets on CCDEX.

Withdrawing of cross-chain asset extraction refers to the extraction of
digital assets mapped on CCDEX to non-CCDEX accounts.

### 2.5.1. Deposit

We take cross-chain deposit BTC as an example.

Step 1, enter the cross-chain asset deposit interface.

Click the "Cross-Chain" menu on the top menu to enter the \"Cross-chain
Asset Deposit/Withdraw\" page. As shown in *Figure 2-38* and *Figure
2-39*.

height="0.4418766404199475in"}

*Figure* *2‑38*

![](.\/media/image55.png){width="5.768055555555556in"
height="3.2430555555555554in"}

*Figure* *2‑39*

In addition, you can enter the \"Cross-Chain Asset Deposit/Withdraw\"
interface of the corresponding digital asset through the \"My Wallet\"
page, in the \"Action\" item of the asset list, click on the \"Deposit\"
of the line of the asset you want to operate. As shown in *Figure 2-40*.

![](.\/media/image56.jpg){width="5.768055555555556in"
height="0.6555555555555556in"}

*Figure* *2‑40*

At this point, the default is the cross-chain asset \"Deposit\"
interface, which can be confirmed by if the \"Deposit\" button is blue.
As shown in *Figure 2-41*.

![](.\/media/image57.jpg){width="2.878163823272091in"
height="0.44997812773403323in"}

*Figure* *2‑41*

You can switch the assets you need to operate through the asset
selection drop-down box, where we select BTC as the object of action. As
shown in *Figure 2-42*.

![](.\/media/image58.jpeg){width="1.5527263779527558in"
height="1.9134612860892388in"}

*Figure* *2‑42*

**Notice:**

**The list of cross-chain assets contains only crypto-assets from
external block chains supported by DCCP cross-chain protocol, not CCDEX
and assets issued on CCDEX.**

Step 2, get the BTC deposit address and complete the deposit operation.

In the \"BTC Deposit Address\" dialog box, there is the BTC cross-chain
asset deposit address. As shown in *Figure 2-43*.

![](.\/media/image59.jpg){width="5.768055555555556in"
height="0.35555555555555557in"}

*Figure* *2‑43*

**Notice:**

**The cross-chain asset deposit of BTC can be completed by simply
transferring BTC to this address, or give this address to other users,
who transfer BTC to the address.**

There are two ways to get BTC cross-chain asset deposit address. The
first is to click the "Show QR code" button and display the QR code for
this address. The address can be sent as a QR code to the user who wants
to transfer BTC to you. As shown in *Figures 2-44* and *Figure 2-45*.

*Figure* *2‑47*

Then send the copied address to the user who wants to transfer money to
you through other means.

### 2.5.2. Deposit Confirm

After the transaction is successful on the external block chain, the
user is required to initiate the deposit confirmation and complete the
asset mapping.

Step 1, get the external block chain transaction.

CCDEX wallets query for successful transactions by deposit addresses.
The new transactions queried will be displayed in history. As shown in
*Figure 2-48*.

*Figure* *2‑52*

Submit the confirmed cross-chain asset deposit transaction, verify and
write to the block, complete the mapping of cross-chain assets. Tips for
successful processing will be displayed at the bottom of the page. As
shown in *Figure 2-53*.

height="0.8673600174978128in"}

*Figure* *2‑54*

### 2.5.3. Withdraw

We take ETH as an example to introduce the operation of cross-chain
asset withdrawal.

Step 1, switch to the Cross-chain Asset withdrawal interface.

There are several ways to switch to the cross-chain asset withdrawal
interface. The first is to click the \"Withdraw\" button in the
\"cross-chain asset deposit\" interface to complete the interface
switching. As shown in *Figure 2-55*.

![](.\/media/image66.jpg){width="2.870229658792651in"

the right of the corresponding asset, it will jump to the withdrawal
interface of this asset too. As shown in *Figure 2-56*.

![](.\/media/image67.jpg){width="5.768055555555556in"
height="0.6506944444444445in"}

*Figure* *2‑56*

Through the asset drop-down box, you can select the digital assets you
need to operate on. As shown in *Figure 2-57*.

![](.\/media/image68.jpeg){width="1.4427482502187225in"
height="1.7779319772528435in"}

*Figure* *2‑57*

Step 2, fill in the cross-chain asset withdrawal transaction.

Fill in the information of the asset withdrawal transaction, including
the target address of the extraction and the amount extracted. As shown
in *Figure 2-58*.

![](.\/media/image69.jpeg){width="5.768055555555556in"
height="1.7020833333333334in"}

*Figure* *2‑58*

**Notice:**

**Cross-Chain asset withdrawal requires consumption of CCD and handling
fees for target assets in external block chain transactions. Therefore,
it is necessary to ensure that both the CCD and the extracted assets in
the wallet have sufficient balances to cover the relevant handling
fees.**

Advanced settings for transaction parameters are made by activating the
\"Advanced\" option. As shown in *Figure 2-59*. If \"Advanced\" is not
activated, the transaction will be set according to the default
parameters.
