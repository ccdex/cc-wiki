## Decentralized cross-chain protocol

*Decentralized cross-chain protocol (DCCP) is a provable security scheme based on MPC algorithm. It is an encryption algorithm used according to the target block chain, completes the generation of public key and signature with N nodes in distributed method. And in the process of generating and using, there is always no complete private key. In this way, the management of cross-chain crypto-assets is realized. After that, we will give the mathematical proof of the related algorithms and the related cryptography research results which we refer to.*

*At present, DCCP has supported ECDSA algorithm, so that DCCP has supported thousands of crypto-assets which use ECDSA algorithm, accounting for about 80% of the total crypto-assets. In the future, DCCP will support other crypto-assets by supporting more algorithms.*

*DCCP is a protocol implemented at the core of the underlying block chain, so it can provide cross-chain support for all applications built on top of the block chain.*

## Distributed memory matching engine
*Distributed memory matching engine uses call auction trading mechanism matched with Block chain periodicity. For more information of this rules, please refer to the "Deal making rules" entry.*

*The matching results are obtained by N Matching Nodes in distributed method. Among these results, only the result which is the biggest turnover will be selected by consensus as the final matching result. For more information of this rules, please refer to the "consensus-based matchmaking results optimization rules" entry.*

*This approach can achieve higher matching performance, and can put an end to front-running to ensure the fairness of the transaction.*

## Transaction liquidity sharing mechanism between Exchanges
*DDCEx.top realizes order sharing channel between different exchanges by building sharing order pool.*

*At the same time, the order sharing incentive mechanism based on Pareto optimal is established. The exchange will maximize the benefit through order sharing, thus realizing the motive force of the exchange to share their order. For more information about order sharing incentives, please refer to "Incentive distribution rules" entry.*

*Through order sharing, exchange alliance and more dynamic ecology will be formed. CCDEx.top platform will have more liquidity and trading depth, resulting in a richer trading application of encrypted digital assets.*
