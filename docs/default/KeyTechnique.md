## Decentralized cross-chain protocol
*All crypto-assets are based on a specific cryptographic algorithm. DCCP implements the connection of crypto-assets by parsing and translating different cryptographic algorithms. In the process of connection, DCCP uses the advanced cryptographic technology, which is based on the secure multi-party computing protocol MPC, to carry out secure multi-party calculations for keys of specific target-type crypto-assets, in order to transparently complete the connection and circulation of different kinds of digital assets. In the whole process of operation and verification, there is no complete key, which eliminates the hidden danger of key leakage.*

*Different from the other cross-chain protocol implement ed in the application layer, CCDEX built the cross-chain protocol DCCP into the core code layer of the blockchain, thus achieving seamless, transparent and efficient cross-chain support for upper-layer applications.*

## Distributed memory matching engine
*Distributed memory matching engine uses call auction trading mechanism matched with Block chain periodicity. For more information of this rules, please refer to the "Deal making rules" entry.*

*The matching results are obtained by N Matching Nodes in distributed method. Among these results, only the result which is the biggest turnover will be selected by consensus as the final matching result. For more information of this rules, please refer to the "consensus-based matchmaking results optimization rules" entry.*

*This approach can achieve higher matching performance, and can put an end to front-running to ensure the fairness of the transaction.*

## Transaction liquidity sharing mechanism between Exchanges
*DDCEx.top realizes order sharing channel between different exchanges by building sharing order pool.*

*At the same time, the order sharing incentive mechanism based on Pareto optimal is established. The exchange will maximize the benefit through order sharing, thus realizing the motive force of the exchange to share their order. For more information about order sharing incentives, please refer to "Incentive distribution rules" entry.*

*Through order sharing, exchange alliance and more dynamic ecology will be formed. CCDEx.top platform will have more liquidity and trading depth, resulting in a richer trading application of encrypted digital assets.*
